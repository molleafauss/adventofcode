# Advent Of Code
My solutions for advent of code (https://adventofcode.com/).

## Diary - December 2022 - trying this challenge

I've started this journey in 2022 by using python. My main language is Java, but I have a good grasp of
python and I like how powerful is for quick prototyping, and I find its readability unsurpassed.

As long as I am not a man of algorithms (background is in networking and system integration), I'm not expecting
to be able to solve all them in time. I'm also trying to make code readable and clean with not too many `l33t` tricks
(some exists but are either commented or pointed out in the code and are quite limited to what the language allows).
I've to say I'm not a fan of such kind of code, true these exercises are just fun stuff, but the ability of writing
comprehensible code that can be easily interpreted is - imho - a bonus and not a minus (and it's what I tend to point
out in my code reviews).

I've added some notes  in every puzzle just as a comment how hard it was or if I needed some extra help to solve it.


## May-July 2023: Finishing what was left unsolved
As expected some of the tougher nuts required some time to solve. I needed to look for other solution, compare, and
rewrite into my code.

For some I was close to the right idea but I didn't have the right structure in mind.


## August 2023: Rust

I started porting and converting all 2022 puzzles to Rust. It's a language I'm interested in, and it was quite a 
good learning opportunity.

This helped me refactor a bit all solutions; all days of a year are compiled in a single binary, and each day can 
be invoked separately, or one can specify `all` to start solving all puzzles in order.

I also added the expected results to all files so I can check that the solution keeps working whenever I refactor
the code.


## September 2023: 2021

I started tacking few problems, I managed to get the first 17 done, but then I had to deal with other stuff and
all the other problems were paused.


## December 2023: ready for next challenge

Waiting for the next challenges coming up. Expect activity in the next weeks. I've a couple weeks off also so "maybe"
I can tackle quite a few problems.
