# Advent Of Code 2022
My solutions for advent of code 2022 (https://adventofcode.com/).

All solutions are posted on the master branch, no commits were cut. Feel free to go through the history and see my 
mistakes.

## Some general notes
Although my biggest background is in Java, solutions are in python. Language is great for quick prototyping 
and is quite easy to read, two qualities that are still unbeatable among other "mainstream" languages.

As long as I am not a man of algorithms (background is in networking and system integration), I'm not expecting
to be able to solve all them in time. I'm also trying to make code readable and clean with not too many `l33t` tricks
(some exists but are either commented or pointed out in the code and are quite limited to what the language allows).
I've to say I'm not a fan of such kind of code, true these exercises are just fun stuff, but the ability of writing
comprehensible code that can be easily interpreted is - imho - a bonus and not a minus (and it's what I tend to point
out in my code reviews).

Each puzzle may contain some extra notes specific to the solution.

### Refactoring post completion
Now that I have solved everything, the code is organised in such a way that it will test for expected output. Each 
input file has the part 1 and part 2 results listed at the top.

### Port to Rust
I've converted all original solutions to Rust. It's a language I'm interested in, and converting the programs I had 
already working, made a fun exercise to understand the language and its quirks better.
