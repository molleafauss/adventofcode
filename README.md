# Advent Of Code 2022
My solutions for advent of code 2022 (https://adventofcode.com/).

All solutions are posted on the master branch, no commits were cut. Feel free to go through the history.

## Some general notes
Although my biggest background is in Java, solutions are in python. Language is great for quick prototyping 
and is quite easy to read, two qualities that are still unbeatable among other "mainstream" languages.

As long as I am not a man of algorithms (background is in networking and system integration), I'm not expecting
to be able to solve all them in time. I'm also trying to make code readable and clean with not too many `l33t` tricks
(some exists but are either commented or pointed out in the code and are quite limited to what the language allows).
I've to say I'm not a fan of such kind of code, true these exercises are just fun stuff, but the ability of writing
comprehensible code that can be easily interpreted is - imho - a bonus and not a minus (and it's what I tend to point
out in my code reviews)

There are branches where I tried to port some of the most interesting puzzles to two other languages I am 
currently interested in learning: Rust and Go. Don't expect these branches to contain all puzzles (they 
eventually will, but I'll "translate" at my own pace).

After a few days, a certain "pattern" in how to approach solutions started surfacing, thus I abstracted some 
"plumbing", and each day file only contains the solution. Not sure that idea will support all puzzles till 
the end.

Each puzzle may contain some extra notes specific to the solution.
