# This was actually "simple" once one realises that flinging a slice into a set would create a set of the expected
# length only if all letters were different.
# one could actually use a single dictionary containing frequency of letters and add/remove as the sliding window moves
# but the code would end up being more involved.
# the `solve()` is an empty method here as the input is a single line
